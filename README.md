# Telco Customer Churn Prediction
In the dynamic and fiercely competitive telecommunications (telco) industry, customer churn is a persistent challenge that can significantly impact a company's bottom line and market position. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition or turnover, occurs when subscribers decide to switch their telecom service providers. This phenomenon is driven by a myriad of factors, including pricing, service quality, customer service, and evolving technology. To combat this issue, telco companies employ various strategies and initiatives aimed at retaining their customers, collectively known as customer retention programs. This introduction provides an overview of the critical concept of customer churn in the telco industry and the need for effective customer retention efforts to mitigate its negative consequences.
