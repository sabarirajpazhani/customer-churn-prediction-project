# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

**Project Overview:**

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry.

**Introduction:**

Customer churn, or attrition, is a critical concern for telecom companies. This project aims to help telecom providers identify and mitigate customer churn using predictive models. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, we can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

**Key Features:**

- Data preprocessing scripts
- Machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Jupyter notebooks for in-depth analysis

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/sabarirajpazhani/customer-churn-prediction.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the analysis and model implementation.

4. Run the predictive models on your own data or use the provided dataset.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used for this project is available in the `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn` directory. It includes detailed customer profiles, services, and churn status.

**Machine Learning Models:**

We have implemented several machine learning models, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

You can choose the model that best suits your needs.

**Contributing:**

We welcome contributions to this project. Please feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or provide feedback.
